### About Me:

I recently completed my Bachelor’s degree in Economics at Boğaziçi University, where I developed a solid background in economic theory, quantitative analysis, and finance. Advanced coursework in financial economics fostered my interest in the intersection of economics, finance, and data science. Through internships at leading financial institutions, I gained practical experience applying econometric and statistical methods to real-world problems, reinforcing my interest in data-driven analysis.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Economics at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) Munich, further strengthening my knowledge in economic analysis and quantitative methods. I’m passionate about analytical thinking and enjoy working with data to test hypotheses, extract insights, and support strategic decisions.
