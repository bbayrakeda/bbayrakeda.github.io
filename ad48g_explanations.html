  <h1>Analyzing High-Technology Exports in the EU</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The primary objective of this study is to identify the key determinants that drive high-technology 
    exports among countries. To minimize the influence of external factors unrelated to 
    macroeconomic dynamics, the analysis focuses exclusively on member states of the European 
    Union. Utilizing a panel dataset covering the years 2012 to 2021, the study incorporates a wide 
    range of macroeconomic, commercial, political, and technology-related indicators.
  </p>
  <p>
    The relationship between high-tech exports and these explanatory variables is explored through 
    various analytical methods, including Elastic Net regularization, decision tree analysis, k-means 
    clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA). These complementary approaches enable 
    the identification of the most influential variables across different domains.
  </p>
  <p>
    Findings from the analysis underscore the critical role of R&amp;D expenditure, trade openness, 
    control of corruption, and GDP per capita in accounting for cross-country variation in 
    high-technology export performance.
  </p>

  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    The key objectives of the study are as follows: (1) to determine which macro-level variables are 
    most strongly associated with high-tech export performance, (2) to cluster European countries 
    based on these explanatory factors and explore the common characteristics within each group, 
    (3) to track and compare the evolution of countries’ positions with respect to these variables over 
    the period 2012–2021.
  </p>

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    This study uses the World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset provided by the World Bank, 
    which offers a rich source of annual, country-level indicators covering a wide range of economic, 
    innovation, governance, and social metrics. Our dataset includes observations for Euro Area 
    countries spanning the period from 2012 to 2022, aligned with the availability of high-technology 
    exports data.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dataset is structured in a long format, where each row corresponds to a country-indicator 
    combination, and yearly values are provided across multiple columns. We focus on a selected 
    set of indicators relevant to high-technology export performance. Key variables include:
  </p>
  <p><b>The dependent variable:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>High-technology exports (current US$)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Innovation and economic indicators:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Research and development expenditure (% of GDP)</li>
    <li>Researchers in R&amp;D (per million people)</li>
    <li>Adjusted net national income per capita (current US$)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Governance and institutional quality:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Control of corruption</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Human capital and infrastructure:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Technicians in R&amp;D (per million people)</li>
    <li>Self-employed, total (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)</li>
    <li>Population ages 15-64 (% of total population)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After preprocessing and feature engineering (e.g., combining patent indicators), the dataset was 
    used for modeling and clustering.
  </p>

  <h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>
  <p><i>Correlation Heatmaps of Selected Countries (Germany, Romania, Spain)</i></p>

  <h2>Elastic Net Regression</h2>
  <p>
    This Elastic Net model was run using only the raw feature set, excluding country and year 
    dummies. It served as an initial step to filter out irrelevant or weak predictors. The selected 
    features from this model were then used in a more comprehensive Elastic Net model that 
    included country and year effects.
  </p>
  <p>
    The results of the Elastic Net regression highlight the relative contributions of various economic 
    indicators to the model's predictive performance. The variables are presented in descending 
    order of importance, with gross fixed capital formation presented as the most influential factor. 
    This is followed closely by GDP per employed person and trade as a percentage of GDP, 
    suggesting these measures play a substantial role in explaining variation in the outcome variable.
  </p>

  <h2>Correlation and Coefficient Direction Check</h2>
  <p>
    In this step, we cross-validated the direction and strength of the relationship between the 
    selected features and the target variable (hightechexports). We calculated the Pearson 
    correlation between each variable and the target, and compared it with the sign of the Elastic Net 
    model coefficient. This allows us to check whether the model's direction (positive or negative 
    effect) aligns with the actual data trend. Variables with mismatched signs or low coefficients can 
    be flagged for removal or further inspection.
  </p>

  <h2>PLM Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    Model finds out that; "taxes_less_subsidies_current_usd", 
    "gdp_per_person_employed_ppp_2021", "control_of_corruption" features are statistically 
    significant.
  </p>

  <h2>Multicollinearity Control with VIF</h2>
  <p>
    In the next step, we further refined our variable selection by applying a multicollinearity check 
    using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). Variables with high VIF scores were excluded to 
    improve model stability and interpretability. The updated variable set was then used to fit a new 
    fixed effects (PLM) model.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the final PLM model, it is shown that: "gdp_per_person_employed_ppp_2021", 
    "control_of_corruption" and "trade_percent_gdp" features are statistically significant.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, feature importance was visualized to highlight the relative contribution of each remaining 
    variable.

  <h2>Decision Tree Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    In this step, we built a decision tree model to explore the patterns behind high-tech exports. The 
    features used in the tree were carefully selected based on previous steps, including Elastic Net 
    regularization, correlation and coefficient direction checks, VIF-based multicollinearity analysis, 
    and panel regression results. This ensured that the tree structure was both interpretable and 
    statistically grounded.

  <h3>Decision Tree Interpretations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The most influential variable is gross fixed capital formation. Countries with higher levels of capital investment tend to have significantly higher levels of high-tech exports.</li>
    <li>Other key predictors include trade as a percentage of GDP, net taxes, and the working-age population share. These variables reflect economic openness, fiscal capacity, and labor force quality.</li>
    <li>The highest levels of high-tech exports (over $200 billion) are observed in countries with high investment, high trade openness, high net taxes, and a large working-age population.</li>
    <li>Conversely, the lowest levels of exports (below $2 billion) are found in countries with very low capital investment.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Clustering Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    We selected 3 clusters based on the results of Elbow method applied to the scaled dataset. The 
    Elbow method showed a clear inflection point at k = 3.

  <h2>PCA Analysis on Countries Over Years</h2>
  <p>
    Visual below shows the trajectories of selected European countries on the PCA space from 2012 
    to 2021 based on macro-level indicators.
  </p>
  <p>
    Countries like Estonia and Poland show a steady upward and rightward movement, indicating 
    improvement across key dimensions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Germany and Sweden, on the other hand, remain relatively stable in the PCA space, suggesting 
    consistent performance over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Italy and Romania display more irregular and shifting paths, reflecting fluctuations or mixed 
    progress in their economic or structural indicators.
  </p>

  <h3>Dimensional PCA Analysis</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Dim.1 (PC1) mainly represents economic and innovation capacity – countries with high GDP per capita, R&amp;D spending, and capital formation score higher on this axis.</li>
    <li>Dim.2 (PC2) reflects institutional quality and demographics, such as political stability, control of corruption, and working-age population share.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Countries moving rightward over time on the PCA plot are improving economically; those moving 
    upward are strengthening in governance and demographic structure. The position and trajectory 
    of each country in the PCA space help visualize multidimensional development over time.

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This study analyzes the macroeconomic and institutional drivers of high-tech exports in 
    European countries (2012–2021). Using Elastic Net, we identified key predictors, with R&amp;D 
    expenditure, income per worker, trade openness, and institutional quality emerging as 
    consistent factors. Panel regressions confirmed their significance, especially the strong effects of 
    R&amp;D intensity and income per capita.
  </p>
  <p>
    To improve reliability, we tested correlations, multicollinearity, and coefficient robustness. 
    Decision tree models further showed that capital investment, trade integration, and 
    governance strength are decisive for higher export performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clustering distinguished three country profiles: (1) open and wealthy economies, (2) transitional 
    economies with weaker R&amp;D and exports, and (3) innovation-driven leaders like Germany. PCA 
    validated these clusters and highlighted divergent trajectories—some countries advancing 
    structurally, others stagnating.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, the findings stress that innovation investment, openness, and institutional strength 
    are critical to sustaining Europe’s high-tech export growth.
